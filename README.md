# PAYDAY2-Birds-Jukebox-Bin
With PAYDAY 2 closing out to PAYDAY 3 within the next few days here, I wanted to add something special: my entire custom tracks catalogue in one package +some unreleased bonuses!

Each of the "Bird's Tunes - ###" folders go into PAYDAY 2/assets/mod_overrides and will function if BeardLib is installed, 
as it requires the integrated BeardLib Music Manager to see custom heist/menu tracks in game.

Included additionally are unreleased heist tracks such as Code Silver (Chaos) and a subfolder of heist track mixes that's volume mixing was [awful] too loud compared to the in-game mixing.
This folder includes volume and remixing for:
Rainbowmaker's 8Bits Are Scary remix,
VxWolf's Sonnenfinsternis (includes alt assault wave mix: original is from their Youtube, alt is from their Soundcloud).
